Each csv file contains 3 columns for accelerometer data, and an 'outcome' column for the label. If the outcome is 1, the user is performing the activity of interest (generally falling). raw91_Testing_Relabeled_Auto_25.csv and raw182_Training_Relabeled_Auto_25.csv both indicate falling if the 'outcome' column contains a 1 at that row of data. This is not true for 'Raw_Data_90ADL.csv', as it contains specific ADLs and no falls, the 'outcome' column is 1 if a specific activity is occuring. In this case that activity is either sitting down, jogging, or hand waving.
